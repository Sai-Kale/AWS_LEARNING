# This is production grade EKS created using the Terraform Files.
* Generally terraform doesnt represent the scalable code.
* The standard software design principle still applies to terraform and in this course we learn Facade Pattern so we can build clean, scalable, manageable and extensive terraform code.
* This contains the C- Compostion, I - Infrstructure_Modules, R - Resource_Moudles in 3 layers.
* Here each File name in the increasing order of number represents the addition of more resources to the previous one.
